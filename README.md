# OpenOx
Open-source Automatic Respirator

A design that makes heavy use of 3D printed parts, to enable makers to quickly assemble an automated ventilator.
OpenOx is based on a 3D printed threadless breadboard, to enable modular design, quickly adaptable to different critical components (such as respirator bags or driving mechanisms).
The vision is to build a library of 3D-printable accessories to fit available parts.

3D-parts designed in Autodesk Fusion360. Everyone is welcome to join, for that your Autodesk Fusion360 email address is required.
Ports to Openscad are welcome!
